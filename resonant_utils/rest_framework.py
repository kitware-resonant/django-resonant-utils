    Pagination class that forces pagination with an upper bound.

    DRF's built-in paginators such as LimitOffsetPagination will cause
    your endpoints to return different structure based on whether or not
    paging parameters were passed in the request. In most cases it's desirable
    to force pagination on endpoints that could return large result sets.
    Using this class has three benefits:

    1. It will always return responses in their paged structure, i.e. a
       JSON Object with "count", and a "results" Array. This is achieved by
       providing a default limit that is used if none is passed.
    2. It enforces a reasonable upper bound on page sizes. Without this, users could
       circumvent the intent of pagination by simply providing a high enough limit.
    3. It adds the Link header to the response, making it easier for clients to
       navigate through pages of results.

    The default limit will be the value of DRF's normal PAGE_SIZE setting, or
    the max limit if that is not set or falsy. The upper bound on the limit is 1000.
